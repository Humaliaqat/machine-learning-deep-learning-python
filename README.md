## Models Used (Car Dataset Project)

The following machine learning regression models were implemented and evaluated:

- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree Regressor  

## Model Evaluation Summary

All models were evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the **lowest RMSE**, indicating the best predictive performance.  
Linear Regression and SVR served as strong baseline models.  
Decision Tree showed comparatively higher RMSE, suggesting potential overfitting.
